## SmartVote -- A Distributed Voting System

A voting system which uses smart contracts to structure the application's logic, and a distributed file store system to share the content between application users.

## Installation

### Warning

This distributed application (DApp) is ready for wider beta testing.

Please note, however, that the blockchain it uses may have to be reset from time to time. We do not currently have a backup/export/import functionality for smart contract housed information (yet), so at this time when the blockchain resets all videos are lost and will have to be readded.

## Installation

### Running the app

When the DApp is running, open [http://localhost:3000/SmartVote/](http://localhost:3000/SmartVote/) in a browser.

## License

GPL. See LICENSE.txt file.

## Contributions

We are happy to accept contributions to this template distributed applications with the proviso that any and all contributions will be licensed GPL by Eris Industries.

Even better than contributions to this template, please press the big FORK button at the top and make the DApp your own. Do cool shit with it.

Run it on your own chain. Connect with your own community. And **most importantly** HAVE FUN!

Enjoy DApp-ing! :)
