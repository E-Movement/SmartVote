## SmartVote -- A Distributed Voting System

A voting system which uses smart contracts to structure the application's logic, and a distributed file store system to share the content between application users.

## Installation

### Warning

This distributed application (DApp) is ready for wider beta testing.

Please note, however, that the blockchain it uses may have to be reset from time to time. We do not currently have a backup/export/import functionality for smart contract housed information (yet), so at this time when the blockchain resets all data are lost and will have to be readded.

## Installation

### Running the app

When the DApp is running, open [http://localhost:3000/SmartVote/](http://localhost:3000/SmartVote/) in a browser.

## License
